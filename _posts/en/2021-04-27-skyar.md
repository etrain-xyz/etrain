### Introduction

AR (Augmented reality) is a technology that lets people superimpose digital content (images, sounds, text) over real-life scenes. AR got a lot of attention in 2016 when the game Pokémon Go made it possible to interact with Pokémon superimposed on the world via a smartphone screen.

Augmented reality is what it sounds like: reality, enhanced with digital components. The most commonly used AR applications these days rely on smartphones to showcase the digitally augmented world: users can activate a smartphone’s camera, view the world around them on the screen, and rely on an AR application to enhance that world in any number of ways:
- Superimposing images
- Adding real-time directions
- Inserting labels
- Changing colors

### SkyAR

SkyAR is a project using AI to create AR Videos. It is a vision-based method for video sky replacement and harmonization, which can automatically generate realistic and dramatic sky backgrounds in videos with controllable styles. Different from previous sky editing methods that either focus on static photos or require inertial measurement units integrated in smartphones on shooting videos, our method is purely vision-based, without any requirements on the capturing devices, and can be well applied to either online or offline processing scenarios. Our method runs in real-time and is free of user interactions.
