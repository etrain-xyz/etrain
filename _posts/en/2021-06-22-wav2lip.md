[Wav2lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10010) is a lip-sync expert, that is all you need for speech to lip generation in the wild

We need a video and an audio, both files have to be exact same length. The audio we will extract from [a Vietnamese video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni2eRUZdJzc) (named `vi-news.mp4`) and the video we will download [an English video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LS4XCNyRKA) (named `en-news.mp4`). See [this guide](/posts/youtube-dl) to download these videos.

```bash
# Cutting the video and audio (14 seconds)
ffmpeg -i en-news.mp4 -ss 00:00:00.000 -to 00:00:14.000 -async 1 en-news-cut.mp4
ffmpeg -i vi-news.mp4 -ss 00:01:27.500 -to 00:01:41.500 -async 1 vi-news-cut.mp4

# Extract audio from vi-news-cut.mp4
ffmpeg -i vi-news-cut.mp4 -q:a 0 -map a vi-news-cut.mp3
```

Upload `en-news-cut.mp4` and `vi-news-cut.mp3` to [the wav2lip web demo](https://bhaasha.iiit.ac.in/lipsync/) and download the result video
